Sample Output
229 230


Explanation

For the given input, the two groups that can be formed following the mentioned rules are:

Group 1: 87 100 41 1
Group 2: 28 67 68 67
The total sum of integers in each of the groups which is as nearly equal as possible is:

Group 1-Total Sum:229
Group 2-Total Sum:230
The total number of integers between group 1 and 2 differ by O integer."""
